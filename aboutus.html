                <p>A group of community activists and senior officials of the Selangor State Government created and registered the "Selangor Orphan Education Organization" with the Registration Number ARS/Sel/50/66 on 16 August 1966 out of a sense of duty and compassion towards orphans. With the acceptance of this registration, the Committee has taken decisive action towards achieving its founding objective. In exchange for their efforts, the Selangor State Government has awarded Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato' Haji Harun Idris and his wife Y.Bhg Datin Salmah Suleiman a parcel of land in Mukim Hulu Kelang (HS.231) with an area of 1.8 hectares (4.8 acres) per permission document number PHT.G.2/139 /75. To ensure that this project can be effectively conducted, Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato' Haji Harun Idris has been selected as the organization's chairman..

                </br>
                 <p>They put a lot of effort into organising events like the Dinner Ceremony, the Premiere, and a call to the membership, and as a result, the group successfully constructed an RBHK for RM158,107.81. DYMM The Sultan of Selangor, Almarhum Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Alhaj ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah, has consented to serve as the organization's patron. In its initial phase, the recruitment of orphans began in 1976 with a total of 26 individuals, including 13 boys and 13 girls between the ages of 6 and 12. On March 5, 1977, His Majesty the Sultan of Selangor officially opened RBHK. The number of orphans has grown yearly, and as of this year, Rumah Bakti is home to 66 orphans ranging in age from 7 to 17 years.</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <p>Two brand-new, two-story dorm blocks were finished on March 2, 1982. The Selangor State Government and public contributions provided the two dormitory blocks, each valued RM600,000. In 1984, a surau was also constructed. A new surau was constructed in 2009 to replace the previous one. The late Dato' Haji Harun Idris' wife, Y.Bhg. Datin Salmah Sulaiman, gave this new surau as a gift. In 1989, RBHK received a new library. In 1997, this library converted to a Resource Center. The former surau, constructed in 1984, was converted into a new Resource Center after RBHK acquired a new surau. The library and the computer room are the two sections that make up the Resource Center.</p>

                 <br>
                 <p>The members of the Selangor Orphan Education Organization have decided to change Rumah Bakti Hulu Kelang (RBHK) to Rumah Bakti Dato' Harun (RBDH), along with the modification of the Rumah Bakti symbol, which was approved by the Registrar of Societies on July 29, 2011, in honour of the late Y.Bhg Dato' Haji Harun Idris.</p>
